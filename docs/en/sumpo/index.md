## History

It all started when the iPhone 3 arrived in Japan in 2009. I bought a used Mac mini so I could try making apps.

To get comfortable with Xcode 3, Objective-C, and Cocoa, I eagerly built apps I personally wanted.

Next, I planned apps to learn Core Data. Even if they were for my own satisfaction, I figured about 100 people worldwide might enjoy them, so I began releasing them on the App Store.

    - Feb 16, 2010 2:23  Mochi Memo 0.2 released — manage travel and camping belongings   (Total: 109,000 downloads)
    - Apr 2, 2010 4:19   Kure Memo 0.1 released — record and aggregate credit-card usage  (Total: 81,000 downloads)

App Store: [Kure Memo Legacy](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A2-legacy/id363741814)　　[Kure Memo](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AC%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A2/id432458298)

During development I realized pickers, typically used for input/selection, could also serve as outputs. I pictured a receipt rolling out of a register and created a drum-style calculator.

    - Aug 7, 2010 9:19   Drataku 0.1 released — later renamed CalcRoll after positive overseas feedback (Total: 55,000 downloads)

As skeuomorphic design gained popularity, I faithfully recreated classic dial-style interactions and built apps to use them.

    - Oct 4, 2011 8:29  Warikan 1.0 released — split-the-bill calculator with dial input for headcount and amounts (Total: 4,000 downloads)
    - Jan 14, 2012 5:45  Body Memo 0.8 released — enter and aggregate weight, blood pressure, etc. with dials (Total: 29,000 downloads)

App Store: [Body Memo](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E4%BD%93%E8%AA%BF%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A2/id472914799)
<br>

In 2025, inspired by the Osaka Expo, I began porting CalcRoll to get comfortable with Swift 6 and SwiftUI. I first submitted it as a new app on Aug 24, 2025, but Apple rejected it for "similar apps exist; lacks novelty." Fair enough! I resubmitted it as an update to the old app and passed review.

    - Sep 4, 2025 8:58  Cal Memo Calclin 2.0 released

App Store: [Cal Memo Calclin](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/%E3%82%AB%E3%83%AB%E3%83%A1%E3%83%A2/id385216637)
<br>

After Calclin launched in Sep 2025, I began migrating Mochi Memo to SwiftUI. About a month later I had an alpha that addressed longstanding issues. I asked AI to generate the sample data on the opening screen, and it turned out surprisingly well! That sparked the idea to add a new "ask Chappie (AI)" feature, which in turn required building a globally scalable API server and managing secure operations.

    - Nov xx, 2025 xx:xx  Mochi Memo Packlin 3.0 released
